Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
#Answer
Software engineering is the systemic application of Engineering principles, methods and tools to develop high quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
#Answer
The development of software developement languages.
Emergence of Artificial intelligence systems.
Emergence of operating systems in the late 90's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
#Answer
Design - this is where a framework of the software is developed.
Testing - This is where the prototype is put into practice to ensure no errors and it is efficiently working.
Deployment - After all the test and programming is done, the software is deployed into the work force or organisation to be used for its intended purpose.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
#Answer
Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when there are no significant changes in scope or technology during the project while Agile on the other hand Agile project management is a good fit in cases where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define, when complex systems require frequent feedback loops, or when timelines and budgets are tight. I.E Startups that often need to deliver products or services with limited resources quickly thus Agile methods allow them to develop and implement ideas more rapidly, allowing for rapid prototyping and iteration on the fly.
Rapid prototyping: Agile can be used to quickly prototype and deliver an end product with high quality without spending too much time on planning, sourcing, approvals, etc.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
#Answer
The software developer will more often than not be involved with programming and ensuring bugs and errors are resolved. A Quality assuarance engineer is involved with ensuring that the quality of the software product complies with a predetermined set of standards. Where as a project manager core role is to ensure that projects meet deadlines, stay within budget, and adhere to quality standards.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
#Answer
IDEs or Integrated development enviroments are important as they provide a platform and help software developers develop code efficiently a good example is Visual Studio code. A version control system on the other serves the importance of tracking and managing software code a good example of a version conrol system being Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
#Answer
Rapid advancement in Technology - software engineers should always be reading and learning about new and emerging software development trends and technologies avoiding redundancy.
Time constraints - a software engineer should have a very good understanding of various development methodologies and skills to ensure the right planning and easiet coding methods are employed to save on time.
Security - as software engineers, we should have patented our work to avoid cases of intellectual property disputes as well as be living in secure enviroments to prevent to burglary of hardware componet vital in software engineering

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
#Answer
Unit testing is whereby individual componets such as functions are tested in isolation. Integration testing is whereby we test the modules of a software under development to see if the funtion together seamlessy while in acceptance testing is where by we test the software in questio to see if the requirements are met. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
#Answer
prompt engineering is about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses in Ai.
Prompt engineering is a powerful tool to help AI chatbots generate contextually relevant and coherent responses in real-time conversations.
In healthcare, prompt engineers instruct AI systems to summarize medical data and develop treatment recommendations.
Prompt engineering is used to develop and test security mechanisms. Researchers and practitioners leverage generative AI to simulate cyberattacks and design better defense strategies. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
#Answer
Who buys bread ? 
Who buys bread at Bread and bakery at 7:00 PM everynight ?
The second prompt if more clear specific and concise as it provides a time, location and specific action at a certain location everyday.
